## Fixing Error

If you're encountering the error "'postgres' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file" in Windows, it likely means that the PostgreSQL executable directory is not included in your system's PATH variable. 

## Check PostgreSQL Installation Directory:

Verify the directory where PostgreSQL is installed. The default installation path is usually 

C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\<version>\bin or C:\Program Files (x86)\PostgreSQL\<version>\bin on 64-bit systems.

##  Add PostgreSQL Bin Directory to PATH:

You need to add the PostgreSQL bin directory to your system's PATH variable. Follow these steps:

Open the Start menu and search for "Environment Variables" or "Edit the system environment variables" and select it.

In the System Properties window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.

In the Environment Variables window, under the "System variables" section, find and select the "Path" variable, then click on the "Edit" button.
Environment Variables

In the Edit Environment Variable window, click on the "New" button, and then add the path to the PostgreSQL bin directory.
Edit Environment Variable

Click "OK" to close each of the windows.
Restart Your Command Prompt or PowerShell:
After modifying the PATH variable, you need to restart any open command prompt or PowerShell windows for the changes to take effect.

## Verify Installation:

```
postgres --version
```
