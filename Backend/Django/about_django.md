# What is Django 

Django is considered a full-stack web framework. 

It is a high-level Python web framework that follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. 

Django provides a set of tools and features for both the front-end and back-end development of web applications.

# Back-end (Server-Side):

## Model

Django provides an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system that allows developers to define data models using Python classes, and it automatically creates the corresponding database tables.

## View 
Django's views handle the processing of HTTP requests and return appropriate responses. Views in Django are responsible for handling the business logic of the application.

### Controller (URL routing): 

Django includes a built-in URL routing mechanism that maps URLs to specific views, allowing for a clean and organized structure.

# Front-end (Client-Side):

### Template system

Django comes with its own template engine, allowing developers to create dynamic HTML pages. Templates help in separating the presentation logic from the business logic.

### Static files handling
Django provides tools for managing static files (such as CSS, JavaScript, and images) and serving them efficiently.

# Admin Interface:

Django includes a powerful admin interface that is automatically generated based on the data models defined in the application. This admin interface allows developers and administrators to manage database records through a user-friendly interface.

# Versitility 

While Django is a full-stack framework, it's worth noting that you have the flexibility to choose and integrate front-end frameworks or libraries (such as React, Vue.js, or Angular) into your Django projects if you prefer a more dynamic and interactive user interface.

This combination is often referred to as a "Django + Front-end framework" stack.
