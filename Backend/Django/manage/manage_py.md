# What is manage.py?

manage.py is a command-line utility in Django, which is a framework for building web applications in Python.  

It acts as a command center for Django, allowing you to execute a wide range of tasks that are essential for developing, testing, and managing your Django application.

Think of manage.py as a tool that helps you perform various tasks on your Django project without needing to dive deep into the code or configuration files.

Here's what manage.py does:

# Starting a Project: 
It helps in setting up a new Django project. 

When you create a new project, manage.py is automatically generated.

# Running the Server: 

One of the most common uses of manage.py is to run your development server. 

You can do this by typing python manage.py runserver in your command line. This command starts a web server that lets you view your Django project in a web browser.

# Database Management: 

Django uses manage.py to handle database-related tasks. 

This includes creating database tables based on your models (migrate), creating new migrations after you've changed your models (makemigrations), and accessing an interactive database shell.

# Testing: You can run tests for your application using manage.py.

# Interacting with Your Project: 

manage.py provides a command-line interface to interact with various aspects of your Django project. 

> For example: you can create a new app within your project, create superuser accounts for the admin site, and much more.
