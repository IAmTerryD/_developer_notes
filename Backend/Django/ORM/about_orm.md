# Object-Relationshal Mapping (ORM)


Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system is a powerful and efficient way to interact with databases using Python code. It abstracts the complexities of SQL and allows developers to work with database tables as if they were regular Python objects. Here are some key features of Django's ORM:

# Models: 
In Django, a model is a Python class that defines the structure of a database table. Each model maps to a single database table, and each attribute of the model represents a database field.

# QuerySets: 

Django ORM allows you to write database queries using Python code. 

A QuerySet is a collection of database queries to retrieve objects from your database. It provides a range of methods to filter, sort, and group data efficiently.

# Field Types: 

Django models support a wide variety of field types, including CharField, IntegerField, DateField, ForeignKey (for database relations), and many others. These fields correspond to SQL data types and provide additional options and validations.

# Database Migrations: 
Django includes a system for managing changes to your database schema (the structure of your database tables) over time. This is known as migrations. Migrations allow you to change your models (add fields, delete models, etc.) and apply these changes to your database schema without losing data.

# Relationships: 
Django ORM supports various types of relationships like ForeignKey (one-to-many), ManyToManyField (many-to-many), and OneToOneField (one-to-one). These are used to define how models relate to each other.

# Aggregation and Annotation:
Django ORM supports complex queries like aggregations (e.g., sum, average) and annotations (e.g., adding extra data to each object in a QuerySet).

# Database Abstraction: 
One of the key benefits of using Django's ORM is database abstraction. Your Django project can be switched between different database backends (like SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL) with minimal changes to your actual code.

# Admin Interface:

Django automatically generates an admin interface for your models, allowing you to create, read, update, and delete records without writing any additional code.

# Lazy Query Execution: 
QuerySets in Django are lazy, meaning they are only executed when you actually need the data (like iterating over a QuerySet). This can lead to more efficient use of resources.

# Caching: 

Django's ORM has a built-in caching mechanism. The same QuerySet will hit the database only once within a view, and further use of that QuerySet will use the cached result.

These features make Django's ORM a powerful tool for developers, allowing for rapid development and clear, concise code for interacting with databases.
