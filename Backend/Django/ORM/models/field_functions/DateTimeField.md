# DateTimeField.md

In Django, a DateTimeField in a model is used to store date and time information. 

When you define a DateTimeField in a Django model, you're telling Django that you want to store both the date and the time in that field.

Here's what it offers:

# Storing Date and Time: 

It can hold values like "2023-12-25 14:30:00", which includes both the date (2023-12-25) and the time (14:30:00).

# Automatic Timezone Handling: 
Django can handle timezones with DateTimeField. 

If you enable timezone support in your settings, Django will store the date and time in UTC and convert it to the appropriate timezone when retrieving it.

# Automatic Date and Time Setting: 

You can use options like auto_now and auto_now_add with DateTimeField. 

## auto_now_add: 

Sets the date/time when the object is first created (useful for creation timestamps).

## auto_now:

Updates an object to the current date/time every time the object is saved (useful for last-modified timestamps).

```
created = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
