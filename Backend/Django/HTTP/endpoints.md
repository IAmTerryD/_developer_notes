# What are endpoints (simplified)?

Sure, let's simplify it even more. Imagine a vending machine. You want a snack, so you go to the vending machine, select what you want, and then get your snack.

In this scenario, the vending machine is like a server in the backend. The buttons on the machine that you press to pick your snack are like "endpoints." Each button (endpoint) has a specific job – if you press the button for a chocolate bar, you get a chocolate bar, not chips.

Similarly, in the digital world, when you do something on an app or website (like clicking a button), it's like you're pressing a button on a giant virtual vending machine. 

This tells the server (vending machine) exactly what you want (like getting your profile info, posting a message, etc.), and the server then responds with the right "snack" – which in this case, is the information or action you requested.
