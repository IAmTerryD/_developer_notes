# JSON Response Parameters: safe

In Django's JsonResponse class, the safe parameter is used to control whether the response content can be serialized safely as JSON. 

It is a boolean parameter, and its primary purpose is to prevent accidental serialization of non-JSON-safe data.

# safe=True

When you set safe=True, it indicates that the content you are providing is already a JSON-serializable object.

In other words, you are telling Django that the data you're passing is safe to be converted into a JSON response without any additional checks or transformations.

# safe=False

Django will perform additional checks on the content you provide to ensure it can be safely serialized as JSON. 

If the content is JSON serializable, Django will be able to convert it. 

If the content is not JSON-serializable, Django will raise a TypeError during the response creation.
