Using React in the frontend with Django Rest Framework (DRF) is a common choice for building modern web applications. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, while DRF is a powerful tool for building RESTful APIs in Django. Here are the steps to integrate React into the frontend of your Django project that uses DRF as the backend:

# Set up your Django project:

In your Django project, you can create a new app specifically for your frontend code. 
You can name it something like "frontend" or "webapp."
Move file into Django directory. 

# Run Build for React

Go to Frontend Directory. 

Install React packages, if packages are not already installed: 

```
npm install
```

### Create the build: 

```
npm run build
```

# Connect React to Django in Configure Settings.py

```
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        "BACKEND": "django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates",
        "DIRS": [BASE_DIR / "frontend/build"],
        "APP_DIRS": True,
        "OPTIONS": {
            "context_processors": [
                "django.template.context_processors.debug",
                "django.template.context_processors.request",
                "django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth",
                "django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages",
            ],
        },
    },
]

# Setup React Static Files
STATICFILES_DIRS = [ BASE_DIR / "frontend/build/static" ]

# Enable CORS
CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = True

REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    "DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES": [
        "rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication",
    ]
}

```

# Create URL for React 

```
# root > urls.py

from django.views.generic import TemplateView

urlpatterns = [
    # Let React handle the routing. This is a class based view.ll
    path('', TemplateView.as_view(template_name='index.html')) 
]
```
