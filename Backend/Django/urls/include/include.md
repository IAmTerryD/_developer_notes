# What is Django.urls.include()?

In Django, the django.urls.include function is used to include URL patterns from other URL configuration modules (Python files) into your project's main URL configuration. 

It simplifies the organization of URLs in a large Django project by allowing you to break up your URL configuration into smaller, reusable parts.


here's a simple explanation of what include does:

# 1. Modular URL Configuration: 

Instead of defining all your URL patterns in a single, monolithic file, you can create separate URL configuration modules for different parts of your application. 

These modules can contain their own URL patterns related to specific features or app components.

# 2. Reusable Apps: 
By using include, you can create reusable Django apps that have their own URL patterns. 

Other projects can include these apps and their URLs easily, making it convenient to use and share functionality across different projects.

# 3. Clean and Maintainable Code: 

include promotes a clean and maintainable code structure, as it allows you to organize your URL patterns logically and keep them separated by functionality or app.

# Code Example

```
# app.urls 

from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.get_routes, name="routes"),
]
```

<p>
We import the include function from django.urls.

We use include('myapp.urls') to include URL patterns from the myapp app. This means that any URLs defined in myapp.urls will be accessible under the root URL of the main project.

In myapp.urls (which would be a separate Python module), you can define additional URL patterns specific to the myapp app:
</p>

```
# project.urls

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    
    path('', include('api.urls'))
    
    # This path checks the folder api/urls/ folder and handles requests with the name "routes".
]
```
<p>
By using include, you can create a more organized and modular structure for your project's URL configuration, making it easier to manage and extend as your application grows.
