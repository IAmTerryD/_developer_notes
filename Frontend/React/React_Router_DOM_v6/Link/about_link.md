# About Link

In react-router-dom, the Link component is used for navigation within a React application. 

It allows you to create links to different routes defined in your application <em>without causing a full page reload</em>, which is typical behavior in standard HTML anchor tags (<a>).

# Key Features of Link:

# Client-Side Routing: 
Link enables client-side routing. When you click on a Link, it updates the URL and renders the new page without a full page reload. This makes navigation between different parts of your React app faster and more efficient.

# Preserving State: 
Since Link doesn't cause a full page reload, the application state is preserved. This is beneficial for maintaining user experience and application performance.

# Declarative Navigation: 
You can specify the destination route declaratively, just like you define an href in a regular <a> tag.

# Customizable: 
It can be styled and customized like any other React component.
