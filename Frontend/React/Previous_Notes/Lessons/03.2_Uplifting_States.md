## Uplifting States

<p>
We lift states in order to use a state in multiple components. We do this by placing the state in a Parent component, then sending references to the Child components that we want to use this state in.
</p>

<p>
As of writing this, both of code blocks are in the Forms component:
</p>

```
  const [items, setItems] = useState([]);

  function handleAddItems(newItem) {
    setItems((currentItems) => [...currentItems, newItem]);
  }
```

<p>
The component that displays the Items are in ItemList component.
</p>

> How do we get the new item created in Forms to be used in the ItemList component?

<p>
We cannot pass the Item object using props, because the Forms not a parent of ItemList (nor should be), it's a sibling. Data can only flow down, not across or up the tree.
</p>

<p>
We do this using a technique involves "lifting up" a state.
</p>

## Steps in Uplifting States

##### Place the state we want multiple items to use in a Parent component.

```
function App() {
const [screen, setScreen] = useState("");
}

```

##### Pass the state into the component that we want it to use.


<p>Last, we give the Parent the handleAddItem function:</p>

<p>We pass in this function to the Forms to use. </p>

```
function App() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState([]);

  function handleAddItems(newItem) {
    setItems((currentItems) => [...currentItems, newItem]);
  }

  return (
    <div className='app'>
      <Logo />
      <Form onAddItems={handleAddItems}/>
      <ItemList items={items} />
      <Stats />
    </div>
  )
}
```

> In otherwords, we place the linked functionalities inside the parent component, and then pass the individual pieces to the children to use.
> Whenever multiple siblings need access to the same states, we move that state up to the first common parent component.
