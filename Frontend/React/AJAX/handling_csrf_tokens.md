By properly handling CSRF tokens in your PUT requests, you ensure that your Django application remains secure against CSRF attacks. 

Remember, maintaining CSRF protection is crucial for the security of your web application.

# Handling CSRF Token in AJAX Requests

For AJAX requests (such as those made from a JavaScript frontend), you'll need to include the CSRF token in the request headers. 

First, get the CSRF token from the cookie:

```

```

# Making Request to CSRF

When making the PUT request, add the CSRF token to the request headers:

```
fetch('/your-api-endpoint/', {
    method: 'PUT',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'X-CSRFToken': csrfToken
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(yourData)
})
```

# Must Add to Django Settings

```
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    "DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES": [
        "rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication",
    ]
}
```

# Using Django REST Framework

If you are using Django REST Framework, CSRF protection is enforced on session authentication.

Make sure the CSRF token is passed in the headers of your AJAX requests as shown above.
