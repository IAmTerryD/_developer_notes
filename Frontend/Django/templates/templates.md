# What are Django Templates?

Templates help you separate the design (HTML) from the code (Python) in your web application. Templates in Django are HTML files enhanced with the ability to include dynamic content. 

# Dynamic Content 

Django's template language allows you to embed variables, loops, and conditionals directly within the HTML. These dynamic elements are replaced with actual data when the template is rendered.

# How Templates Are Rendered

Views in Django use templates to generate HTML responses dynamically. When a view is called, it processes data and passes it to a template, which is then rendered to create the final HTML page.

# What is Template Inheretence

Django templates support inheritance, allowing you to create a base template with a common structure and extend it in other templates. It allow you to reuse HTML elements.
