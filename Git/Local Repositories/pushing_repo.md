# Push Your Code to GitHub:

Push your commits to GitHub with:

```
git push -u origin master 
```
The -u flag sets the upstream for your branch, so in the future, you can simply use git push to push to the same branch.

Enter Your GitHub Credentials:
If prompted, enter your GitHub username and password. If you have two-factor authentication enabled, you'll need to enter a personal access token instead of a password.


# How to add comments

Adding comments directly to a git push command isn't possible since git push itself is just a command to upload your local repository content to a remote repository. However, you can add comments to your commits, which are then pushed to the remote repository. Here's how the process typically works:

# Make Changes in Your Local Repository:
First, you make changes to your files in your local repository.

## 1. Stage the Changes:

Use git add to stage the changes for commit. You can add all changes with git add . or specific files with git add filename.

## 2. Commit the Changes with a Comment:
When you commit these changes, you add a comment that describes what you did. 

This is done using the -m flag with the git commit command. 

```
git commit -m "Your detailed commit message here"
```

Here, "Your detailed commit message here" is your comment. 

It's best practice to make this message descriptive, so it's clear what changes were made when looking back at the commit history.

## 3. Push the Commits to the Remote Repository:

Finally, you use git push to send your commits to the remote repository. If it's your first time pushing to this repository, you use:

```
git push -u origin master
```

In this case, origin is the default name Git gives to the remote you cloned from, and master is the branch you're pushing to. 

The -u flag sets the upstream for your branch, so in subsequent pushes you can just use git push.
